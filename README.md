# Exploratory Design Analysis: Ceramic Factorial Design

## Project Overview

### 1. Background

UBA Ceramic Sdn. Bhd. is facing challenges with the strength of its ceramic tiles, leading to customer complaints and product returns. To address this issue, the company is investing in research and development to enhance the strength of its ceramic tiles during production. The focus is on investigating the machining factors that influence ceramic strength, including table speed, down feed rate, wheel grit, direction, and batch.

### 2. Experimental Design

The experiment employs a 2^5 factorial design, with each factor having two levels. This design results in 32 different combinations of the five factors, with each combination tested to determine its impact on ceramic strength.

The factors under investigation:
- A: Table Speed
- B: Down Feed Rate
- C: Wheel Grit
- D: Direction
- E: Batch

The goal is to identify which factors, in combination and at which levels, have the most significant effect on ceramic strength.

### 3. Data Collection

The data from the experiment has been collected and is available in the provided CSV file (please download first). The dataset, shown in Table 1, includes information on the strength of the ceramic for each combination of factors.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 4. Objectives

The objectives of the EDA are as follows:
- Understand the distribution of ceramic strength across different factor combinations.
- Identify any patterns or trends in the data.
- Determine if there are any outliers or anomalies in the dataset.

### 5. Key Steps

1. **Load the Data:**
   - Import the dataset from the provided CSV file.

2. **Explore Data Distribution:**
   - Analyze the distribution of ceramic strength.
   - Utilize visualizations such as histograms and box plots.

3. **Identify Patterns and Trends:**
   - Explore relationships between individual factors and ceramic strength.
   - Consider interactions between factors.

4. **Detect Outliers:**
   - Identify any outliers that may impact the analysis.

5. **Summary and Insights:**
   - Summarize key findings from the EDA.
   - Provide insights into factors influencing ceramic strength.

## Conclusion

The Exploratory Data Analysis aims to lay the foundation for further statistical analysis and modeling to identify the optimal machining factors for enhancing ceramic strength in UBA Ceramic Sdn. Bhd.'s production line.
