Ceramic Factorial Design

A ceramic tile manufacturing by UBA Ceramic Sdn. Bhd. was facing issues with its ceramic tile production line. The tiles were breaking easily during installation and customers were complaining about the poor quality of the tiles. The company realized that it needed to increase the strength of its ceramic tiles to meet the demands of its customers and to improve its reputation in the market.

The ceramic tiles produced by the company were weak and prone to breaking easily. This was causing a high rate of customer complaints and product returns, which was affecting the company's revenue and reputation.

The company decided to invest in research and development to increase their ceramic tilesâ€™ strength. They suspect the machining factor of ceramic production influences the strength of the ceramic tile. Thus, they wish to investigate the machining factors that influenced the strength of the ceramic during their production. The five factors thought to influence the strength of the ceramic are table speed (A), down feed rate (B), wheel grit ( C ), direction (D) and batch (E). The experiment would involve using a 2^5 factorial design, with each factor having two levels. This would result in 32 different combinations of the five factors, each of which would be tested to determine the strength of the ceramic during production. The results of the experiment would then be analyzed using statistical methods to identify which factors have the greatest effect on the strength of the ceramic and in what combination and levels. The data from the experiment has been collected are shown in Table 1.
